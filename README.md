# Building-a-Modular-Docker-Stack-with-Flask-MariaDB
In this build, I’m deploying a modular, containerized microservice stack using Flask (for API logic) and MariaDB (as the relational data layer), orchestrated with Docker Compose.

It’s a pattern I’ve used often in production simulations, dev pipelines, and prototyping pipelines—simple to set up, yet powerful in demonstrating container networking, volume persistence, and service orchestration.

Why this stack?

Flask: Clean, minimal, fast. Great for simulating internal APIs, webhooks, and integrations.

MariaDB: Proven MySQL-compatible engine with Docker-friendly images.

Compose: Ideal for abstracting multi-container logic without overengineering for local dev.

This isn’t about proving Docker works—it’s about architecting clean, reproducible environments that mirror cloud deployments. A fully containerized workflow allows me to test connectivity, resilience, and scalability without polluting the host system or relying on external services.
What I’m documenting throughout this build:

Efficient environment setup using GitHub Codespaces

Containerized Flask API build with Dockerfile

Persistent database storage using named volumes

Secure service-to-service communication via Docker Compose networks

Lessons from real debugging moments — not just happy-path guides

What you gain by treating local builds like production pipelines
For engineers looking to level up their cloud and DevOps stack:
You don’t need to wait until you’re “ready” — start using production-grade tools early. The habits you build now (clean separation, repeatable builds, declarative config) are what separate hobbyists from professionals.

This stack is lean, real, and extensible — and over the next few entries, I’ll walk through how I build it, test it, and think through decisions from a DevOps perspective.

Let’s build systems, not just apps.
